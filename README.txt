BCB 570 Project Outline 

Dataset:
Data downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website: 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geoprofiles/41147670 

Data contains the gene expression profiles in Leukocytes of patients with Sepsis. Ill patients 
have gram-positive or gram-negative sepsis. The data also contains the control (healthy samples). 

Prospective topics:
1. Differential gene expression in healthy, vs ill patients 
2. Differentiate the GO enrichment analysis between healthy, gram-negative sepsis, gram-positive 
   sepsis patients 
3. Dimension reduction and visualization from gene expression profiles 
4. Create a gene regulatory network using expression profile and human transcription factors (downloaded from
    TFDB)
